## TODO

- [ ] POC Langchain, Ollama, React.js, BUN???? That would be great! <https://g.co/gemini/share/1a4a0058b0a4>

Hey. It's been a few weeks since I post stuff here. I'm writing this blog post to show the coolest thing I learned in this period of not posting.

## Introduction

I've been off the trend of building using AI lately, so I thought that actually building a conversation with a LLM was too complicated for me. Turns out I found out about [Langchain](https://www.langchain.com/) and their open source libs, such as [Langchain Core](https://js.langchain.com/docs/introduction).

Turns out it's really straighforward to send and receive messages from an AI agent when you use Langchain.

In this blog post I'll show not only how to send/receive data, but how can you actually build a React component that receives the stream of the text and displays to the user real-time, with basic markdown and code block's styling, using some cool React libs I found along the way.
