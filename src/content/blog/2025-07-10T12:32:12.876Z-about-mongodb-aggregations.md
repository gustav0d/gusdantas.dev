## Introduction

Most of the things I did with MongoDB so far involved using [mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) to perform basic CRUD operations.

I had already heard of MongoDB aggregations but never stopped to learn more about it. This changed recently when I was fixing an issue that involved a MongoDB aggregation pipeline, which kind of freaked me out at first because I had no idea what it was and how it worked.

Turns out they're pretty straightforward and really, _really_, useful.

## What is an aggregation in MongoDB?

As [MongoDB docs](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/aggregation/) put it:

> Aggregation operations process multiple documents and return computed results

So whenever you think about certain operations like:

- getting the total sum of products that a certain user has
- counting the valid users (e.g. `Users` with `removedAt: null` and `emailVerified: true`) of your system
- filtering data that involves multiple documents
- grouping documents by a certain value

You can use - and probably should be using - aggregations to do that.

## Why should you use it?

As I've said, I had some experience with Mongoose for basic CRUD operations before, so my usual approach to the operations above would be something like:

- `await ModelOne.find()` for a certain (or multiple) document(s)
- use another `await ModelTwo.find()` for querying/filtering a different set of documents that requires information from `ModelOne`
- ...repeat the steps above (super inefficient)
- then on again on JavaScript side:
  - `Array.length` to count the fields
  - group them with [`Object.groupBy`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/groupBy)
  - create some more complex function or use an external lib for operations

Nothing of it is inherently bad, but it's far from optimal, especially for the amount of `await`'s (even using something like `Promise.all()`).

With aggregations instead, you can move _all_ that logic to the database layer, this means that you'll leave the database engine to do the joining and processing (no reason to have multiple `await`'s). That enables you to avoid performance bottlenecks and poor concurrency.

## How MongoDB does that? Aggregation pipelines

MongoDB aggregations runs in pipelines. Each step of the pipeline is called a stage, and there are a lot of [stages](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/aggregation-pipeline/#db.collection.aggregate---stages).

In each stage you can process, transform or filter documents in a collection. And _each stage is the output for the next stage_. In that way, you can have multiple stages, passing them forward in the pipeline, combine data from different documents, join collections and, in general, have MongoDB executing a much more complex and robust logic on its side (instead of your application's). That is, you have a wide range of possibilities to deal with _any document_ in your database, in whichever way you prefer, without worrying about making your server's code too messy.

> For more optimized queries (and a more in-depth content) see [aggregation pipeline optimization](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/aggregation-pipeline-optimization/), especially about [indexes](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/aggregation-pipeline-optimization/#indexes)

Stages that I used the most and were really helpful:

- `$lookup` to performs an outer join in the collection specified
- `$match` to perform filters
- `$project` to specify the inclusion or exclusion of given fields; for example:
  - setting `_id: 0` to exclude the `_id` field
- `$unwind` for deconstruct an array field
  - really useful when you expect your filter to find a single document to be used on a next stage

### Expression operators

Expressions operators are some useful built-in functions. They can be used for:

- [string](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/#string-expression-operators) operations
  - regex
  - date from string
  - concatenate strings
  - replace text
  - remove whitespaces
  - split a string into substrings
- [arithmetic](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/#arithmetic-expression-operators) expressions
  - subtract
  - multiply
  - power
  - sum
  - absolute
  - value
- [arrays](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/#array-expression-operators)
  - reduce the values
  - map the values
  - get a subset of an array
  - sort
- boolean expressions (and, not, or)
- [dates](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/#date-expression-operators)
  - difference between two dates
  - get day of the month, year, week
  - get hour
- [much more stuff](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/#expression-operators)

## Example

As a simple example, let's say you have two collections: `User` and `Product`. You want to fetch all valid products (not removed) given the user that's logged in bought:

```js
db.users.aggregate([
  {
    $lookup: {
      from: "Product",
      let: { userId: "$_id" },
      $match: {
        removedAt: null,
      }
      pipeline: [
        {
          $match: {
            $expr: {
              $eq: ["$userId", "$$userId"]
            }
          }
        }
      ],
      as: "products"
    }
  }
])
```

Now we can access the products via the `products` array:

```json
{
  "_id": "64a...",
  "name": "Gustavo",
  "products": [
    { "_id": "99a...", "name": "Product 1", "userId": "64a..." },
    ...
  ]
}
```

## Conclusion

I hope this post helped you to at least grasp the idea of why and how MongoDB aggregations can be useful and more performative for your projects.

I'm open to answer any doubt or just talk more about it (or any other cool stuff you might want to chat about). Just contact me in any of [my links](/contact).
