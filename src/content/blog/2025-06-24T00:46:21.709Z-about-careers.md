In this post I'll write some things I've learned that might help you understand yourself better professionally and hopefully improve your (and mine) chances to get hired.

## Career

A career is what you call an individual's journey through learning and work. You can grow vertically or horizontally in your career.

Horizontally, you can be more technical in a specific field, like front-end development.

Vertically is what people used to think about growing on an enterprise, like from being a janitor up until manager.

## Responsibilities

Now let me talk to you ðŸ«µ.

- You are responsible for planning your career
- You are responsible to guarantee that you keep up with the competition on the long term
- The company can but doesn't have the obligation to help you develop yourself in your career

## How to keep yourself competitive

> TLDR: you need to have [skin in the game](/blog/a-quick-word-about-having-skin-in-the-gam)

Now that you now you are responsible and accountable for the decisions you take from now on, there are some topics that, if you keep in mind, they will help you to keep yourself competitive.

### Look for tendencies

- what technologies are hyped at the moment?
- what do other employees do that makes the manager happier or give the company more profit?
- what can you post on social media that can get you more visibility?
- Have a non-linear line of thought: analyze your decisions; having more challenging decisions means you're improving your value as a decision maker

### Multidisciplinarity

- talk with different people from different places with different competencies
- work with projects you've never done before
- make decisions you never made before

### Challenges over your career

These are some challenges you will face during your whole career.

- Volatility: things change all the time, you need to be _resilient_ to keep yourself competitive
- Uncertainty: You need to be antifragile and flexible
  - I recommend reading The Drunkward's Walk (by Leonard Mlodinow), Antifragile and Skin In The Game (both from Nassim Taleb) in order to improve yourself even more on matters of uncertainty
- Complexity
  - This is even more important nowadays with LLMs; it is way less important that you can code per se, but way more important that you are able to choose the best approach for that solves the problem the safest, most efficient way
  - [Multidisciplinarity](#multidisciplinarity) can help you with it
- Ambiguity: You must make a decision (not deciding is _still_ a decision); for that, you need the _courage_

## Competence - skills

Being competent is delivering high quality of execution and high quality result.

How can you be more competent? You need to be able to answer these questions about the situation:

- What are you doing? Why?
- How are you doing it?
  - what abilities you need?

And most of all, you must have attitude, true and honest desire for doing it.

> Book recommendation: "The quest for competencies" by Scott B. Parry

There are technical competencies, called hard skills, and behavioral competencies, called soft skills.

You need hard skills since they are specific requisites for a profession or job you'll be doing, yet, nowadays it is relatively easier to learn and actually build things faster.

Soft skills, on the other hand, are harder to develop and usually matter more when hiring or [keeping yourself in a job](https://g1.globo.com/economia/concursos-e-emprego/noticia/2018/09/18/9-em-cada-10-profissionais-sao-contratados-pelo-perfil-tecnico-e-demitidos-pelo-comportamental.ghtml).
