This week's been pretty hard on my barista job. It's a holiday in Brazil alongside a huge car event that happens every year in my town and it's well known in the region, there are a lot more tourists and people in general visiting the coffee shop, so I'm non stop the whole day and have way less time and energy to read and study (things I sometimes do over there when there's no work to be done).

## An Achievement

I finished a course from Oracle ONE. I posted it on LinkedIn ([click here](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/dantas15_gustavo-dantas-curso-desenvolvimento-de-activity-7341281892211535872-aJ2H)).

I learned some stuff that were probably stopping me from advancing on recruitment processes, especially the personality ones. For example, I used to think that saying different things on "what you think about yourself X what others think about you" was a good thing, but it's quite the opposite, those questions are useful to understand your self knowledge:

- what you and others know about you
- what others know but you don't about yourself (blind spot)
- what you know about yourself but others don't (fa√ßade)
- what is unknown (you might discover it when you face a situation that you'll be "forced" to do something you were previously afraid, for example)

This is called [Johari Window](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johari_window).

Besides this course, I started prospecting a new freelance project that I might land in the next few weeks (I'm really excited because it's challenging yet exciting opportunity for developing my sales and technical habilites)

## What is next

This week I plan on:

- [ ] Finishing 2 more courses on Oracle ONE
- [ ] Create a plan for selling the freelance project
- [x] Create a blog post about what I learned from the course (I'm thinking about naming the post "What the market expects of me: soft and hard skills") ([click here](/blog/about-careers))
- [x] Adapt my LinkedIn according to what I learned from the course
- [ ] Finish reading Skin in the game
