I recently came up with [this post on X](https://x.com/ocodista/status/1963966595652538773) about using the same repository in different directories locally. I confess I used to do the same, not for AI, but especially when reviewing code or working on different issues at the same time.

Besides cloning a repo multiple times, my workflow using git is basically checking out to different branches, stashing changes if I need, often losing some changes in the processs of unstashing them - yes, skill issue I must confess.

But, with git worktrees I can solve all those issues, and still not to care about losing changes when unstashing ongoing changes.

## Basic workflow

## Conclusion

Git worktrees solved a real pain point in my development workflow. No more losing changes when unstashing, no more context switching between branches, and no more cloning repositories multiple times just to work on different features.

The learning curve is minimal - if you're comfortable with basic git commands, you'll pick this up quickly. The productivity gains, especially when working on multiple features or reviewing code, are immediate.

Give it a try on your next project. Start with creating a worktree for a feature branch and see how it feels. I'm confident you'll find it as useful as I do.

If you have any questions or want to share your own git worktree workflows, feel free to [get in touch](/contact) or reach out on [X](https://x.com/gusdantas).
