This week I was not as productive as I was expecting, but that was probably because I really raised the bar on exercising. I'm now running 3 or 4 times a week and trying to recover my calisthenics training (I'll definitely post some stuff I'm taking notes about it in the future).

## Review

From [last week's](/blog/2025-06-22-weekly-update) planning, I was able to achieve most of the things:

- I finished [one more course](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/dantas15_certificate-of-completion-gustavo-dantas-activity-7344208692789006336-b93m) from Oracle ONE
  - I failed to complete 2 more courses
- I posted a [blog post about careers](/blog/about-careers)
- I adapted my LinkedIn experiences from what I've learnt from the courses
- I didn't finish reading Skin in the game
  - I'm actually ok taking time to read it, I've been learning a lot of things lately and it's fine that reading this book isn't a priority anymore.
- I haven't written the E-commerce platform for portfolio nor have I written the proposal for the customer because I got a more urgent opportunity that I'm (hopefully) getting this week

## What is next

- [x] Read one more chapter of Skin in the game
- [x] Start working as a freelancer OR write the e-commerce proposal and project (for portfolio and for selling)
- [/] Finish 1 more Oracle ONE course
