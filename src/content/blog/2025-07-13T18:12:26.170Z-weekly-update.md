## Review

Since [last week](/blog/2025-07-08-weekly-update), I

- Started a mentorship with Scarlet from Growly Group on 2025-07-12
  - (now I have an individual development plan for my software engineering career!)
- Read MOC (Manual de Orientação do Contribuinte) for building NF-e system
- I posted [about MongoDB aggregations](/blog/about-mongodb-aggregations)
- I started writing about [getting productive with automated testing](/blog/getting-productive-with-automated-tests)

## What is next

- Understand more by start building NF-e system (maybe create a post here or multiple TIL's?)
- Try tro commit and iterate more when building stuff or fixing bugs
- On weekends, especially on Sundays try to focus more on Oracle ONE
- [ ] Write a blog post about integration tests
- [ ] Read one more chapter of Skin in the Game
