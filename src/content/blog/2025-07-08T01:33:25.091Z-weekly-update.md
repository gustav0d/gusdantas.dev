## Review

Since [last week](/blog/2025-06-29-weekly-update), I:

- Failed to finish a course on Oracle ONE
- Got a new job as a freelancer
- Learned a lot about MongoDB Aggregations
- Learned a lot about integration tests (guess I'll finally write something more on [this](/blog/getting-productive-with-automated-tests))
- I read one more chapter of Skin in the game

## What is next

- [/] Finish 2 Oracle ONE courses
- [x] Read one more chapter of Skin in the game
- [x] Write a blog post about MongoDB Aggregations ([link](/blog/about-mongodb-aggregations))
- [/] Write a blog post about integration tests
