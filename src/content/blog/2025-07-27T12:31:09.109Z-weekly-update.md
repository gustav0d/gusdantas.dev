It has been 2 weeks since [the last weekly update](/blog/2025-07-13-weekly-update). I had some change of plans amidst these last few weeks.

## Review

- I had an issue that I was stuck (even before the last weekly update), that would only happen in production, so it was really difficult to debug it
  - After some time I found out the BullMQ Worker was getting stuck when trying to fetch and store all the data needed for building a XLSX file
  - In order to fix this, I had an attempt to use Node.js Streams, a different library for building xlsx files (`exceljs`) and finally, a way do upload it to Amazon S3
  - It f*cking worked first try it went to prod (I couldn't believe it at first)!
  - I remember that I did this last Sunday, I started in the late afternoon and went until 2AM. Totally worth it.
- I learned a lot about NF-e and NFS-e
  - The [challenge](https://github.com/woovibr/jobs/commit/3a9200bf9c0ebcd8c5470bba5f37d13556d9372f) now went from NF-e to NFS-e
  - I discovered that it is required for my city or the company itself to be "confederated" in order to use the [NFS-e Nacional](https://www.gov.br/nfse/pt-br/biblioteca/eventos_NFS-e/eventoTecnicoSetembro2022)
  - I got stuck on it. I'm trying to contact people that have a clue on how to test NFS-e emission
  - If you have a clue, please [contact me](/contact)
- I'm having some difficulty on keeping up with Oracle ONE, since I'm having a lot of more interesting challenges and opportunities besides it
  - I started Oracle ONE this year, when I had no opportunity on software engineering planned, but (gladly), I'm having a lot of valuable opportunities that I simply cannot let go of right now
- I haven't read much on Skin in the game this last two weeks, maybe a few pages
  - This week I spent a lot of time on social media as well, this definitely hindered me.
