While reading [Stop Building for "Scale." You Don't Have Users Yet](https://dev.to/shayy/stop-building-for-scale-you-dont-have-users-yet-4aep) by Shayan, I realized what just PostgreSQL has to offer:

- **Real-time updates**: Instead of Reids pub/sub, use Postgres LISTEN/NOTIFY
- **Background jobs**: Instead of RabbitMQ or Kafka, use Postgres as queue
- **Full-text search** using Postgres instead of *Elasticsearch*
- **Vector search**: Just use `pgvector`

If you're wondering if this will not scale, I recommend reading the original post before jumping to conclusions.
