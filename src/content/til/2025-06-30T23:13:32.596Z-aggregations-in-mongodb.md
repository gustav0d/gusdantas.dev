An aggregation in MongoDB is used when you want to:

- Group values from multiple documents together
- Perform operations on the grouped data to return a single result
- Analyze data changes over time

The best way of using aggregation is with aggregation pipelines, where you can have multiple [stages](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/aggregation-pipeline/#std-label-aggregation-pipeline-operator-reference). And in each stage you can process documents, from the [docs](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/aggregation/#aggregation-pipelines):

- Each stage performs an operation on the input documents
  - For example, a stage can filter documents, group documents, and calculate values.
- The documents that are output from a stage are passed to the next stage.
- An aggregation pipeline can return results for groups of documents.
  - For example, return the total, average, maximum, and minimum values.
