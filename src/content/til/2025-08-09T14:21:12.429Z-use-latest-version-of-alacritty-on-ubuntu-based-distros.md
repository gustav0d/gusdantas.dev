I tried doing this because I'm currently using Pop!_OS and the version of alacritty available in the `apt` is outdated. I want to use the latest features and improvements.

One cool way to install it is through Cargo, which allows you to get the latest version directly from the source.

> For up-to-date dependencies for your OS and instructions, refer to the [official Alacritty installation guide](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/blob/master/INSTALL.md#dependencies)

Install `.deb` dependencies:

```bash
sudo apt install cmake g++ pkg-config libfontconfig1-dev libxcb-xfixes0-dev libxkbcommon-dev python3
```

> If you're using Wayland on Nvidia GPU, you should also install `libegl1-mesa-dev` on Ubuntu.

You should have `rust` installed. [Instructions here](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started#installing-rust).

Install Alacritty using Cargo:

```bash
cargo install alacritty
```

You'll probably have to add it as an alternative (skip it if it appears as alternative already)

```bash
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/x-terminal-emulator x-terminal-emulator $HOME/.cargo/bin/alacritty 50
```

Set as default terminal:

```bash
sudo update-alternatives --config x-terminal-emulator
```
