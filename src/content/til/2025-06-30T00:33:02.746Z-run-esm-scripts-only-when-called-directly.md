I faced an issue when trying to see if a script of my blog was running directly or being imported.

Before ESM I would try:

```js
if (require.main === module) {
  run();
}
// otherwise, I could use the import/exports without worrying about it running other stuff
```

But this throws `ReferenceError: require is not defined in ES module scope, you can use import instead` if you're using ESM.

In order to fix it, you can use the following snippet:

```ts
import path from 'node:path';
import fs from 'node:fs';
import { fileURLToPath } from 'node:url';

if (process.argv[1] === fileURLToPath(import.meta.url)) {
  run();
}
```
