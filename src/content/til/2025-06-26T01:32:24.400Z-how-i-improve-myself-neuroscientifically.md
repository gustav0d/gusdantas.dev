- nothing gets easier by itself
- my brain starts automating what I do most, or what I spend most of my energy doing
- something becomes progressively easier each time I do it
- this means that if I learn a mathematic topic and do exercises about it every day, it will be progressively easier to do these mathematic exercises; it also means that if I complain about my life and do absolutely nothing about it every day, I will get better at it (start making more sophisticated, more convincing, for example)
- the answer for getting better and making something become easier is simple: _do more_.
