In `settings.json` you can change the defaults from `activeEditorShort` to
activeEditorMedium, so it properly displays the full workspace's realative
path to the file you're editing. This really helps me to navigate in codebases
that have several `index.tsx` in it.

```json
{
  "window.title": "${activeEditorMedium}${separator}${rootName}${separator}${profileName}"
}
```
