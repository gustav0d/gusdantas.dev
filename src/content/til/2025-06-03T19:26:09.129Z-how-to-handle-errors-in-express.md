You can throw errors in Express and handle them correctly.

In [this gist](https://gist.github.com/gustav0d/4dac3e064626d2c5c47d6a4e232c9fe5#file-servererrorcatcher-ts) I put an example of how you can use it with Zod to customize the ZodError to a readable error message.

Before Express V5 you had to use `express-async-errors`, but now you can do this automatically.
